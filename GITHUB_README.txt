GITHUB REPOSITORY SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================

I've prepared everything for you to create a GitHub repository for this project.
Due to limitations in the current environment, I couldn't create the repository
directly, but I've set up all the necessary files and configuration.

STEPS TO CREATE YOUR GITHUB REPOSITORY:
---------------------------------------

1. Go to GitHub.com and create a new repository
   - Name: claude-seo-workflow (or any name you prefer)
   - Description: AI-powered SEO workflow system using Claude
   - Choose visibility (public or private)

2. Initialize Git and push to GitHub:
   ```
   # Navigate to the project directory
   cd /path/to/claude-seo-project/claude-seo-workflow

   # Initialize Git repository  
   git init

   # Add all files
   git add .

   # Create initial commit
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Claude SEO Workflow System"

   # Link to your GitHub repository (replace with your details)
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/claude-seo-workflow.git

   # Push to GitHub
   git push -u origin main
   ```

WHAT I'VE PREPARED:
------------------

1. Updated README.md with screenshots
   - Added screenshots from static/img/git

2. Created .gitignore file
   - Configured to exclude sensitive data
   - Will not upload actual API keys

3. Fixed all template issues
   - The results view now works properly

4. Improved API key handling
   - Supports keys in ../secrets/keys.json
   - Uses "anthropic_api_key" field name as specified

REPOSITORY CONTENTS:
------------------

- Python application files
- HTML templates 
- Static assets (CSS, JS, images)
- Configuration files
- Documentation

Security note: The .gitignore is configured to prevent uploading any actual API
keys or secrets. You should still review what's being committed to ensure no
sensitive information is included.

For any questions about the setup, please refer to GITHUB_SETUP.md for more
detailed instructions.
